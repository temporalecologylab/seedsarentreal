\maketitle


\begin{enumerate}

\item Intro (all forests $\rightarrow$ stand sync $\rightarrow$ ind. trees)
%\begin{itemize}

%\item Widespread meltdown fears\\
%$\rightarrow$ maybe mention invasion, homogeneization, pest outbreaks...\\
%$\rightarrow$ regeneration shifts... masting!
The acceleration of climate change is predicted to have abrupt ecological effects worldwide \citep{Trisos2020}. Rapid shifts to novel climate conditions with more extreme events could disrupt key ecological processes -- and potentially drive ecosystems toward critical transitions \citep{Wernberg2016}. % Feedback mechanisms could break down resilience
In particular, many forest ecosystems are showing sign of increased sensitivity to biotic and abiotic disturbances \citep{Albrich2020, Forzieri2022}. Forests have the potential to adapt only if they can rely on their regeneration capacity, which promotes post-disturbance recolonization % and the establishment of 
with individuals better adapted to new conditions \citep{Stevens‐Rumann2017, Turner2023}.

% \item Meltdown and masting
% \begin{itemize}
% \item simple definition of masting
% \item ...
% \item end paragraph on masting being hypothesized as critical to regeneratino via seed predator overwhelmed... or pollen etc. and this could have big effects!
% \end{itemize}
Regeneration in many temperate and tropical forests depends on tree species that have a high reproductive variability across years, and where most individuals of a population reproduce synchrounously. These two characterisics---variability and synchronicity---define masting. Masting is hypothesized to have strong fitness benefits, mostly because high seed production could overwhelm seed predators---i.e. a higher proportion of seeds and seedlings could escape predation and establish. Masting could also favor greater pollen exchange and genetic outcrossing across individuals, favoring the production of seedlings that may be better adapted to new climatic conditions.

% \item How does masting work? Synchrony
% \begin{itemize}
% \item individual trees need to be synchronized within certain distance (but maybe not further...)
% \item population-level characteristics! So how do individual treews do it together?
% \end{itemize}
% ... Population-level masting arises 
Disruption of this reproductive timing by climate change could trigger cascading effects on forest resilience. Masting is a population-level characteristic that require individual trees to respond similarly to environmental cues in order to reproduce together within a certain distance---which should match with predator foraging range. Tree species that mast have likely evolved under colder climates, and warmer conditions could modify the reproductive cues that allowed for both variability and synchrony within the population.

% \item How do individual trees cue to mast?
% \begin{itemize}
% \item what is a good year environmentally... warm summer, no frost
% \item but that doesn't cause synchrony! No cues can cause 2-year cycles or other cycles...
% \item however, most trees take 2 years to make buds, and have alternate bearing
% \item (Conceptual figure)
% \end{itemize}
 Understanding the reproductive behavior that arises at the population level requires to study individual trees' responses to cues. Reproductive success requires that an individual tree experienced good environmental conditions---and in particular no late spring frosts and sufficiently warm temperatures during the growing season.



% \item Combo of cues + constraints\\
% $\rightarrow$ could explain what we see?
% \begin{itemize}
% \item year before need warm summer...
% \end{itemize}

% \item So ACC could really screw this up
% $\rightarrow$ but to know this, we need to model the individuals!

% \end{itemize}

\item Results and discussion

\begin{itemize}

\item We built a model that matches conceptual figure
\begin{itemize}
\item alternate states (latent)
\item states encode constraints 
\item tree level estimates lead to stand estimates!
\item and we added climate
\end{itemize}

\item Model identifies 2 states (here, figure with the two distributions)
\begin{itemize}
\item masting is real! Mirror the intro
\item some level of synchrony within stands
\item say how often they transition in average conditions...
\end{itemize}

\item Climate impacts on masting (figure of climate effects)
\begin{itemize}
\item warm summer increase transition
\item frost decrease number of seeds 
\item no efect of spring (supp mat)
\end{itemize}

\item Our projections vs current studies
\begin{itemize}
\item current studies: ACC leads to more seeds via more masting
\item but even if you drive warming way upp you still get a plateau
\item this even happens with summer temp effect on M to M (figure proj)
\item To actually ahve a breakdown, we would nee the parameter valeu on M to M to be at least as important as NM to M
\end{itemize}

\item How constraints prevent breakdown!
\begin{itemize}
\item ...
\end{itemize}

\item But synchrony does appear to go down
\begin{itemize}
\item Review previous results and overall figure
\item these years look less synchrone\dots
\item but here, it could be driven both by within and between asynchrony
\item (what level of between-stand synchrony predict..?)
\item evolutionary benefits of mating depends on scale of synchrony \\
$rightarrow$ which scale depends on which evolutionnary model you consider, but for seed predators... should be quite small (foraging distance = X km)
\end{itemize}

\item Asynchrony indeed driven by multiple factors
\begin{itemize}
\item within between
\item discuss results... maybe figure with \%?
\end{itemize}

\item What drives synchrony? 
\begin{itemize}
\item bad years could act as precise cue, and with biol. constraints it would explain the following synchrony 
\item how ACC could change those dynamics, and on which scale?
\item (Unclear how breakdown at tree and then at stand level?)
\item basically, we need to figure out the biology useful for predictions with ACC
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
