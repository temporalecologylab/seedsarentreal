\section{Introduction}

% \item Intro (all forests $\rightarrow$ stand sync $\rightarrow$ ind. trees)
%\begin{itemize}

%\item Widespread meltdown fears\\
%$\rightarrow$ maybe mention invasion, homogeneization, pest outbreaks...\\
%$\rightarrow$ regeneration shifts... masting!
The acceleration of climate change is predicted to have abrupt ecological effects worldwide \citep{Trisos2020}. Rapid shifts to novel climate conditions with more extreme events could disrupt key ecological processes---and potentially drive ecosystems toward critical transitions \citep{Wernberg2016}. % Feedback mechanisms could break down resilience
In particular, many forest ecosystems are showing sign of increased sensitivity to biotic and abiotic disturbances \citep{Albrich2020, Forzieri2022}. Forests could adapt only if they can rely on their regeneration capacity, which promotes post-disturbance recolonization % and the establishment of 
with individuals that may be better adapted to new conditions \citep{Stevens‐Rumann2017, Turner2023}.

% \item Meltdown and masting
% \begin{itemize}
% \item simple definition of masting
% \item ...
% \item end paragraph on masting being hypothesized as critical to regeneratino via seed predator overwhelmed... or pollen etc. and this could have big effects!
% \end{itemize}
Regeneration in many temperate and tropical forests depends on tree species that have a high reproductive variability across years, and where most individuals of a population reproduce synchrounously. These two characterisics---variability and synchrony---define masting. Masting is hypothesized to have strong fitness benefits, mostly because high seed production could overwhelm seed predators---i.e. a higher proportion of seeds and seedlings could escape predation and establish. Masting could also increase greater pollen exchange and genetic outcrossing across individuals, potentially favoring adaptive evolution via the production of new phenotypes more suitable in novel climates \citep{Carlson2014, Bontrager2019}.

% \item How does masting work? Synchrony
% \begin{itemize}
% \item individual trees need to be synchronized within certain distance (but maybe not further...)
% \item population-level characteristics! So how do individual treews do it together?
% \end{itemize}
% ... Population-level masting arises 
Disruption of masting timing by climate change could trigger cascading effects on forest resilience \citep{Bogdziewicz2023, Foest2024}. Masting is a population-level characteristic that require individual trees to respond similarly to environmental cues in order to reproduce together within a certain distance---which should match with predator foraging range. Tree species that mast have likely evolved under colder climates, and warmer conditions could modify the cues that allowed for both reproductive variability and synchrony across a population.

% \item How do individual trees cue to mast?
% \begin{itemize}
% \item what is a good year environmentally... warm summer, no frost
% \item but that doesn't cause synchrony! No cues can cause 2-year cycles or other cycles...
% \item however, most trees take 2 years to make buds, and have alternate bearing
% \item (Conceptual figure)
% \end{itemize}
Understanding the reproductive behavior that arises at the population level requires to study individual trees' responses to their environment. Reproductive success requires that a tree experienced favorable environmental conditions---and in particular no late spring frosts and sufficiently warm temperatures during the growing season. Yet, the alternation between favorable and unfavorable years is not invariant and cannot explain the regular intervals at which masting can occur \citep{Janzen1978}. 

At the individual level, the alternating reproductive cycle may mainly arise from endogeneous factors. In many tree species, floral buds are initiated the year before flowering, simultaneously as fruits of the current year start developing \citep{Geber1997}. During a large crop year, the presence of many fruits could  depress floral initiation because of hormonal inhibition and resource `competition' for photosynthetic assimilates \citep{Monselise1982, Milyaev2022}. These physiological constraints on flower and fruit development could explain while trees often show alternate bearing---with a large crop year (`on-year') often followed by one or several `off-years'. 
% "the competitive overlap of flower bud formation for the subsequent season and fruit development during the current season"

% \item Combo of cues + constraints\\
% $\rightarrow$ could explain what we see?
% \begin{itemize}
% \item year before need warm summer...
% \end{itemize}
The combination of endogeneous constraints and local climatic conditions could explain how individual-level inherent alternation leads to masting behavior at the population scale \citep{Matthews1955, Monselise1982}. Floral bud initiation requires warm summer temperatures \citep{Vacchiano2017}.  Unfavorable or favorable summer conditions could synchronize individual reproductive cycles within a population---and this synchrony may then persist over several years.

% \item So ACC could really screw this up
% $\rightarrow$ but to know this, we need to model the individuals!
Anthropogenic climate change could alter the climatic cues that synchronize individual reproductive cycles. Reliable forecasts of its potential consequences for long-term population-level synchrony requires to model how individual endogeneous constraints and climate act together. 

\section*{Results and discussion}

% \item We built a model that matches conceptual figure
% \begin{itemize}
% \item alternate states (latent)
% \item states encode constraints 
% \item tree level estimates lead to stand estimates!
% \item and we added climate
% \end{itemize}

We developed a model in which individual trees alternate between latent reproductive states that explicitly encode endogenous constraints. For each observed tree, the model estimates the reproductive state and the subsequent seed production. Climate is included as an explicit driver both of state transitions (probability matrix), and of reproduction intensity (number of seeds). From these individual reproductive dynamics, the model allows to scale up to population-level behavior---to investigate how climate interacted with endogenous constraints to impact masting in the last decades.

\begin{itemize}


\item Model identifies 2 states (here, figure with the two distributions)
\begin{itemize}
\item masting is real! Mirror the intro
\item some level of synchrony within stands
\item say how often they transition in average conditions...
\end{itemize}

\item Climate impacts on masting (figure of climate effects)
\begin{itemize}
\item warm summer increase transition
\item frost decrease number of seeds 
\item no efect of spring (supp mat)
\end{itemize}

\item Our projections vs current studies
\begin{itemize}
\item current studies: ACC leads to more seeds via more masting
\item but even if you drive warming way upp you still get a plateau
\item this even happens with summer temp effect on M to M (figure proj)
\item To actually ahve a breakdown, we would nee the parameter valeu on M to M to be at least as important as NM to M
\end{itemize}

\item How constraints prevent breakdown!
\begin{itemize}
\item ...
\end{itemize}

\item But synchrony does appear to go down
\begin{itemize}
\item Review previous results and overall figure
\item these years look less synchrone\dots
\item but here, it could be driven both by within and between asynchrony
\item (what level of between-stand synchrony predict..?)
\item evolutionary benefits of mating depends on scale of synchrony \\
$rightarrow$ which scale depends on which evolutionnary model you consider, but for seed predators... should be quite small (foraging distance = X km)
\end{itemize}

\item Asynchrony indeed driven by multiple factors
\begin{itemize}
\item within between
\item discuss results... maybe figure with \%?
\end{itemize}

\item What drives synchrony? 
\begin{itemize}
\item bad years could act as precise cue, and with biol. constraints it would explain the following synchrony 
\item how ACC could change those dynamics, and on which scale?
\item (Unclear how breakdown at tree and then at stand level?)
\item basically, we need to figure out the biology useful for predictions with ACC
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
